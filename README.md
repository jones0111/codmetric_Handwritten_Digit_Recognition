MNIST Digit Classification

Project Description:
This project implements a handwritten digit classifier using the MNIST dataset with TensorFlow/Keras.
It loads the MNIST dataset, preprocesses the images by normalizing pixel values and one-hot encoding labels, builds and trains a basic neural network model, evaluates the model’s performance using accuracy, visualizes the training process with loss and accuracy plots, and tests the model on sample images to display predicted digits.

Libraries Used:
NumPy - Numerical computations
TensorFlow / Keras - Model building, training, and evaluation
Matplotlib - Visualization of training progress and predictions

Output Example
Model accuracy score:
Test accuracy: 0.975

Training progress visualization
Loss and accuracy plots showing training vs validation performance over epochs

Sample predictions
Image: Digit 7 → Predicted: 7
Image: Digit 2 → Predicted: 2
Image: Digit 1 → Predicted: 1
Image: Digit 0 → Predicted: 0
Image: Digit 4 → Predicted: 4
